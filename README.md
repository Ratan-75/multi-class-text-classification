**Software Product Classification and Categorization
(With Product Description and License Information)**

**Intro:**

* Software product business is evolving very fast 
* Internet has grown rapidly and businesses now are going digital 
* Software products account for substantial economic activity all over the world
* It has now become a compulsion to have access to the latest data on every subject 
* Purchases of Software licenses has been increasing from large enterprises to individual users
* This project focuses on Machine learning classification models for software categorization

**Background**

- Software Asset Management is a business strategy that involves managing & optimizing assets.
- Aids in reclaiming budget and maximizing savings by controlling procurement and deployment of software licenses

**Objectives**

* Understand the current scenario of software product classification and broad categories in which they could be placed.
* Designing a model that could correctly tag a particular software based on either keyword(s) in product name and from product description text.
* A search mechanism to extract the correct information from the web about a particular software. 
* To identify the product type (Licensable / Not-Licensable) of the software given that the License information is available in internet.

**Scope of Work**

Scope of this dissertation is to design and build a classification model using Machine Learning algorithms that could predict the software product category from software product description.
Retrieve license information for a given product if license data is available on public websites or e-Commerce / re-seller websites. 
Application areas: 
- Classification Model: To Categorize a software product.
- Information Extraction: To extract the correct information of a particular software.
